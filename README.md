# Table Tennis Club Management System

## Welcome to TTCMS!

A solution for table tennis clubs, where a head coach can manage members, their memberships, upcoming tournaments, results, and registrations for new members. <br>

This solution utilises jQuery on the frontend, accompanied with Bootstrap for styling. On the backend, FlightPHP was used, further accompanied with Swagger annotations for API documentation, and JWT authentication. <br>

This is a course project for IT 207 - Introduction to Web Programming at International Burch University. The project carries 25% of the total course grade.
